# Surfs_up - Weather Data Analysis

### Overview
This project performed an analysis of weather in Hawaii, as reported by a collection of weather stations around the state.  The weather data would be used to enable investors to decide whether to help fund a new business venture.

### Methodology
A sqlite database containing the weather observations was examined by using Python, Sqlalchemy, Flask, and a Jupyter Notebook with Pandas.




## Results








## Recommendations for Further Analysis

The analysis should contain the following:

    Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
    Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
